 CLiCC is a Common Lisp to C Compiler.  It generates C-executables 
 from Common Lisp application programs. CLiCC is not a Common Lisp 
 system.  Hence it does  not  include any  program  development or 
 debugging support.  CLiCC is intended to  be used as an  addon to 
 existing Common Lisp systems for generating portable applications.
 
 CLiCC supports a subset of Common Lisp + CLOS, which we call CL_0
 (CommonLisp_0).  CL_0  is a strict and very large  subset of full
 Common Lisp + CLOS, without  (EVAL ...) and friends.  At present,
 CL_0 is based on CLtL1,  but  we  are  working towards  CLtL2 and
 ANSI-CL.
 
 The target language is a subset of C. CLiCC is adaptable to gene-
 rate ANSI-C or K&R-C by using a compiler option.  The generated C 
 code is compilable using  a conventional C compiler on the target 
 machine,  and must be  linked with the  CLiCC runtime library  in
 order to generate executables.

 The file INSTALL describes the installation of CLiCC and the file
 src/compiler/README describes how to use the compiler.  Check the
 file NOTES for details about this new release.
 
 Look into the directory doc for papers about CL_0,  the generated 
 C code, the used intermediate representation of programs, and the
 migration of Common Lisp programs to CL_0.
 
 If you have any problems using CLiCC, please contact us.      Any
 suggestions or ideas to improve  CLiCC  are welcome.  We are very
 interested  in hearing  about  you,  even if you just used  CLiCC
 successfully.
